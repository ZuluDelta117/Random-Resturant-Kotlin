Kotlin/src/main/kotlin/Food.kt
# Overview

This program uses classes to orginize lists, functions, while loops, random selection, and takes user input.
The program has the bulk of the code split between a class and function which are both called within the main function.
The main function also has most of the user interface displaying options and taking user input. The main function will loop 
Until the user decides they are done using the program. 

This program allowed me to see some of the similarities between Java and Kotlin as well as decide which language I like more for future projects.
It alos gave me some hands on experience learning some of the Kotlin syntax.

My Wife and I also have a hard time deciding where to eat sometimes and this will make that easier.

# Development Environment

Libraries and IDE that I usede in the devalopment of this program
-  IntelliJ Idea: IDE that I used, Easier to set up for Kotlin than Visual Studio Code
-  java.util.Scanner: Allows for user input

Kotlin is similar to Java and they share a lot of the same libraries such as the scanner library that I used above. 
It is an object oriented programing language meaning it runs with fnctions, classes, and other declarable objects.

# Future Work

- Move resturants lists to a (or sevearal) text file(s)
- Allow user to add more resturants to the text file
- Allow user to two lists and merge them for a random selection
- Allow user to ask for two options that they can pick from
